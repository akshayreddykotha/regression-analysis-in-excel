# Regression analysis in excel
This analysis has a small dataset which explores the dataset from application point of view and I hope it would be a precursor to complex analysis using the same or different technique. 

*Note*:
* Microsoft Excel's regression limits to linear regression analysis however one can try to fit with one independent variable or multiple independent variables.
* R2 is *R-squared value* which is defined as the measure of proprortion of variance of dependent variable explained by the independent variable. The higher the proportion, the better is the relationship between dependent and independent variable/s.

## Dataset - Transit Demand:
This is a transit demand data set and the dependent variable under consideration is **Number of weekly riders** and there are four independent variables whose predictability we want to know.

### What do the trends say?

All the scatter plots helps use decide to go for a linear regression model

**Assumptions to apply linear regression model:**
1. There must be a linear relation between independent and dependent variables. 
2. There should not be any outliers present. 
3. No heteroscedasticity 
4. Observations of the error term are uncorrelated with each other. It is called as Auto-correlation.
5. Absence of multicollinearity.
6. All independent variables are uncorrelated with the error term
7. Error terms should be normally distributed with mean 0. 

Though it is not an exact linear relation, the whole purpose of modelling is to understand the uncertainty complemented with statistical analysis. Let's apply the regression technique and discover if the assumptions get validated without which our model doesn't stand a suitable fit for the given data and future predictions.

### Results of the model:

![Results of regression - Transit demand](https://github.com/akshayreddykotha/regression-analysis-in-excel/blob/master/images/regression-ouput.PNG)

**R2 Value** = 0.95

While R2 is one parameter to look out for, the most standard way is to check the residual plotst to evaluate the model. The more random the errors are, the better your model. It means you shouldn't be able to form a pattern in any part of the plot as far residuals are concerned.

### Evaluation of fit/ model:
**1. There must be a linear relation between independent and dependent variables.**

The first assumption can be validated from the scatter plots and the results of the regression which showcases different coefficients and the fitted values are calculated using the linear equation. Y = β0 + β1X1 + β2X2 + .... + (error)

**2. There should not be any outliers present.**

The residuals mustn't be more than 3 standard deviations away from the residual mean. Let's check that with a calculation of standardized residuals.

![standardized residuals](https://github.com/akshayreddykotha/regression-analysis-in-excel/blob/master/images/standardized-residuals.PNG)

The maximum value is **2.20** standard deviations away from the mean with which we can move ahead.

**3. No heteroscedasticity.**

This means the residuals must have a constant variance across all the observations. The residual vs fitted values plot tells about it.

*Residual plot for this model*:

![Residual plot - Transit demand](images/residual-output-transit-demand.PNG)

In our residual plot, the variance fans in which is a sign of heteroscedasticity. A different interpretation is that it can be seen that for fitted values < 140000 of the **Number of weekly riders** variable, residuals are -ve while they are +ve in between [1400000, 150000]. This made me easy to find out a pattern which is not the desired outcome when checking for goodness of fit via residual plots.

To remove heteroscedasticity (pure), either **re-defining the variables** or **weighted regression technique** (How in MS-Excel? - Coming soon) or **Dependent variable transformation** can be applied and convert the analysis to homscedastic. However, this only matters when understanding the effects of independent variables and not if prediction making is the main goal. Upcoming: Weighted Regression Techniuqe.

*Note*: To remove impure form of heteroscedasticity, subject-matter expertise is needed as the main concern is finding out the key variables which are reflected in the non-constant variance.

**4. Observations of the error term are uncorrelated with each other.**

If there is a pattern and one error term (generally the order in which observations are collected) helps in predicting the next error term, then there is problem.

![error-term-correlation](https://github.com/akshayreddykotha/regression-analysis-in-excel/blob/master/images/residual-vs-observation-order.PNG)

To randomize this serial correlation, independent variables which can be attributed to such effect has to be added and required subject matter expertise. It is out of scope for this analysis as the data set is constrained with respect to the number of independent variables.

**5. Absence of multicollinearity.**

This means no independent variable is a perfect linear function of other explanatory variables. Just like the case of heteroscedasticity, if predictions are the main goal, evaluating mutlicollinearity can be skipped and I have skipped it. But if interpreting coefficients, p-values are of major concern, then **Variance Infation Factor** helps in finding out multicollinearity.

**6. All independent variables are uncorrelated with the error term.**

This has to be taken for granted as there was no precursor information about the data set. And all the given variables were included in the model which lead to a good R2 value (0.95).

**7. Error terms should be with mean 0.** 

![mean-error-terms]()

It can be seen that the mean of residuals/ error terms is very tiny and can be approximated to 0. This assumption will be however validated as ours is a linear model and we have the constant **β0** which takes care of it by forcing the mean of residuals to zero.


### Conclusion:

In all the required assumptions, multicollinearity and heteroscedasticity are the one which we are uncertain of but as far as predictions are concerned, we can surely ignore the discrepancies with those two assumptions. From a statistical analysis POV, it is highly recommended to dig deep into making this a better model by different solutions offered. Feel free to pitch in if you'd like to perform a deep dive into it. I look forward to working on it as I explore more of the regression analysis technique.
